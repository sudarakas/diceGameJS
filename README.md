        <h3 class="helptopic">So how do you play?</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Choose a player to go first. That player throws a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesnâ€™t roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.</li> 
            <li>If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.</li>
            <li>Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="helptopic">How do you win?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The first player to accumulate <strong>100 or more points</strong> wins the game.</li>
        </ul>
